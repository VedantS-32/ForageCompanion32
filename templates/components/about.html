            <p>
                ForageCompanions uses a state-of-the-art deep learning model specifically trained on a diverse dataset of mushroom species from around the world. Here's how our identification process works:

            <div class="ai-process">
                <div class="process-step">
                    <div class="step-number">1</div>

                        <h3>Image Analysis</h3>
                        <p>
                            When you upload a mushroom photo, our AI analyzes key visual features including cap shape, gill structure, stem characteristics, color patterns, and texture.

                        <h3>Species Matching</h3>
                        <p>
                            The extracted features are compared against our database of thousands of mushroom species. The system calculates confidence scores for potential matches.

                        <h3>Information Retrieval</h3>
                        <p>
                            For identified species, we pull comprehensive information from our curated database, including edibility, habitat preferences, and potential toxic lookalikes.

                        <p>
                            Our system automatically flags potentially dangerous species and provides clear warnings about toxicity risks, even for species with moderate confidence scores.

            <p>
                While ForageCompanions strives for accuracy in mushroom identification, we emphasize that no AI system is 100% perfect. Our tool should be used as an educational aid and not as the sole basis for determining edibility.
            </p>
            <p>Always follow these safety guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Never consume wild mushrooms based solely on an app's identification</li>
                <li>Always get verification from multiple expert sources</li>
                <li>If in doubt, throw it out - no mushroom meal is worth the risk</li>
                <li>Be aware of potentially fatal lookalikes for edible species</li>
                <li>Start with small amounts when trying a new edible species</li>
            </ul>
